### About

<!--
**mdschirmer/mdschirmer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Instructor in Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Here, I apply my theoretical background combined with my interest in neuroimage analysis across the life-span to further research to improve our understanding of diseases, such as stroke, and the associated outcome for patients. In my current work, I promote the use of clinical magnetic resonance images in large scale analyses. My goal is the facilitation of translational research to the point where theoretical neuroimage analysis can be used to understand individual differences in patients. This will help support medical decision making and personalize treatment options for patients in order to improve their long-term outcome.
